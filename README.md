# Alien Invasion

## About
Alien Invasion is a project created using the book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. I personally drew the sprites for the game characters, but other than that the code was learned and followed using the mentioned book.

## Usage
This program can be run by installing python and typing 'python alien_invasion.py' from the command line inside of the root folder of this project.
 - Press 'q' at any time to quit.
 - High scores will save untill the game is restarted.
 - The alien ships will move faster with each increase in level.

## Future Plans
I plan to add additional sprites to this game for unique aliens and ship upgrades that modify the bullets and how they act.
